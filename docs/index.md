## About Me
I am a technology driven 10th-grade student at The Hunterdon County Computer Science and Applied Engineering Academy and a member of FTC team 12601.  Over the past few years, I have completed several tech-related projects such as building a [CNC](Projects/CNC.md) from scratch, creating my own personal [VPN](Projects/Pi-VPN), and designing and hosting this [website](Projects/Website.md).

This website was last updated on 9/4/2021 and is a work in progress.  If you have any questions feel free to email me at [john@jbrereton.com](mailto:john@jbrereton.com) or leave a comment on any of the project pages.
